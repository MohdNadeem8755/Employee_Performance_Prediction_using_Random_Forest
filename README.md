## ðŸ“‚ Dataset  
The dataset contains employee attributes like:  
- Age, Gender, Department, Education, Experience  
- Job Role, Training Hours, and other HR-related features  
- Target: **Employee Performance Rating**  

---

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy**  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**  
- **Scikit-learn (Random Forest Classifier)**  

---

## ðŸ“Š Workflow  
1. Data Preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, handling missing values)  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Model Building with Random Forest  
4. Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)  
5. Feature Importance Analysis
